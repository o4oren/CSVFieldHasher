## CSVFieldHasher
[![Release](https://github.com/o4oren/CSVFieldHasher/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/o4oren/CSVFieldHasher/actions/workflows/release.yml)
This small application was created as a way to fiddle a little with Electron while solving a problem we were facing
of needing to read CSV files, and hash the values of a specific column - by employees with no technical disposition.

Just browse to a csv file, select the column and hash away!
